### Introduction to Nextflow and Seqera Platform

#### What is Nextflow?

Nextflow is a workflow system for creating scalable, portable, and reproducible workflows. Nextflow is composed of two parts - a language and runtime. 


The language offers many features useful for computational research, including:

- A caching mechanism to allow users to quickly test new ideas without sacrificing reproducibility.
- Naive Git support for version-aware workflows and runs.
- Workflow portability. Nextflow workflows are abstracted from infrastructure specifics, so the same workflow can be run on popular traditional grid scheduling systems such as Slurm and IBM LSF, as well as cloud services such as AWS Batch, Google Cloud Batch, Azure Batch, and Kubernetes.

#### Running a Nextflow pipeline

Nextflow provides a simple command line interface for managing and executing pipelines.

Let's take a look at how to run a basic, Nextflow pipeline using a simple [Hello World script](https://github.com/nextflow-io/hello).

1. First, ensure Nextflow is installed:

   ```bash
   curl -s https://get.nextflow.io | bash
   ```

2. With Nextflow installed, you can then run the following on your command-line to start running the hello pipeline:

   ```bash
   nextflow run https://github.com/nextflow-io/hello
   ```

#### Monitoring and Finding logs

When you run a Nextflow pipeline via the CLI with `nextflow run`, it generates logs that can be used to monitor the execution of the pipeline. The logs are printed to the console, and detailed execution trace can be found in the work directory created by Nextflow. Each execution generates its own directory under work, where logs and output files are stored.

- **Execution Log**: The main log file (`nextflow.log`) is created in the directory where Nextflow is run. This file captures detailed information about the pipeline execution, including system errors and warnings.
- **Command Log**: Within the work directory, each process execution generates a `.command.log` file, which contains the standard output and error streams of the executed command.

#### Limitations of CLI

Nextflow on the command line is a powerful tool for an individual researcher to grow an idea into a reproducible lab notebook, and then into a production-grade reproducible pipeline. As you grow - either as a team, or in terms of run volume, new challenges arise including:

- **Scalability**: As the number of tasks increases, manually checking individual log files becomes impractical.
- **Real-Time Tracking**: The CLI does not offer an easy way to visualize real-time progress across multiple parallel tasks.
- **Aggregation**: Collecting and interpreting logs from various processes requires additional tools or scripts, complicating the workflow management.
- **Flexibility**: Switching between environments (i.e. your local computer to HPC, or cloud) requires the setup of access in the form of account keys and credentials to the environment on your CLI, followed by using the appropriate Nextflow configuration settings.

#### Enhancing management of Pipelines in Seqera Platform

Seqera Platform extends the capabilities of Nextflow by providing advanced monitoring, and pipeline and data management tools:

- **Centralized Monitoring Dashboard**: A user-friendly interface displays all critical information, including real-time progress of each pipeline.
- **Easily Accessible Run Details**: Seqera Platform captures every detail about a pipeline run, including the exact parameters and configurations used, ensuring full reproducibility.
- **Resource Usage Metrics**: It provides comprehensive metrics on resource usage for each task, crucial for optimizing cloud executions and managing costs effectively. These metrics are presented in an accessible format, contrasting with the complexity of extracting and interpreting them from CLI logs.
- **Explore and Manage Data**: The Platform makes it easier to manage data across disparate sources for your pipeline executions without having to use Cloud consoles or CLI utilities.
- **Analyze your Data**: Interactive notebooks, RStudios environments, and VSCode streamline the analysis of your data generated from pipeline executions.

This guide will demonstrate the various features of Seqera Platform which makes it easier to build, launch, and manage scalable data pipelines.
